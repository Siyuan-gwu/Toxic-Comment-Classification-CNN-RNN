# Toxic-Comment-Classification
To build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models.

## We built 3 models, which are BNN, CNN and RNN.
### Four steps to build models
* Data Exploration and Analysis: Correlation Matrix, Heatmap, Head and Checking Missing/Duplicate values
* Data Preprocessing: Use embedding models and convert the comments to the same length sequences
* Building model: Baseline Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network
* Evaluating Results: Evaluation accuracy score of all the models, as well as the confusion matrix
